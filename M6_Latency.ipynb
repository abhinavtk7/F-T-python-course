        "We even throw our own exception, a common superclass for most IO exceptions, `IOError` when there is a problem with the payload. It is maybe helpful to subclass IOError (or a more appropriate error class) to create more specific exceptions - [see this link for a tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-userexceptions). Remember that the decision in an `except` statement, whether to handle an exception or pass it on it, is based on the class. Creating your own allows you to grab it (and only it) in a `try-except`."
